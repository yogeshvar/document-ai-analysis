# Document Analysis Benchmark

A comparative analysis of document understanding solutions tested on a welfare assistance form. This project evaluates how various AI models and services extract information from complex documents.

## Solutions Tested

### AI Models
- **Claude (Anthropic)**
- **Deepseek**
- **OpenAI GPT**

### Specialized Tools
- **LLM Whisperer** - Layout & text analysis
- **Donut** - Document understanding model
- **DocuPanda** - Form extraction tool
- **Google Document AI** - Cloud document processing

## Results

Each solution's results are available in their respective directories:

- `claude/` - Claude's JSON output
- `deepseek/` - Deepseek's JSON output
- `openai/` - OpenAI's JSON output
- `llmwhisperer/` - Layout and text analysis
- `donut/` - Donut model results
- `docupanda/` - DocuPanda results
- `document-ai/` - Google Document AI results and visualization

## Analysis

The solutions were evaluated on their ability to:
- Extract text accurately
- Identify form fields
- Structure data appropriately
- Understand document layout
- Handle checkboxes and tables
